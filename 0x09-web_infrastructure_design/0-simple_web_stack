Explanation

User Request: A user types "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]" into their web browser. Their computer needs the IP address associated with that domain name.

Domain Name System (DNS):

Domain Name: The "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]" is your domain name, giving the web server a human-friendly address.
DNS Record: The "www" part is a subdomain. It has an 'A record' in the DNS system mapping it to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
DNS Lookup: The user's browser contacts a DNS server to find the IP address associated with "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]".
Server:

Definition: A server is a powerful computer designed to handle requests and provide services to other computers (clients) over a network.
Web Communication:
HTTP Protocol: The server and the user's computer use the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate. The user's browser sends an HTTP request, and the server sends back an HTTP response.
Web Server (Nginx):

Role:
Listens for incoming HTTP requests.
Handles static content (HTML, CSS, images) directly.
Forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Application Server:

Role: Executes your application code (likely written in a language like PHP, Python, etc.). This code generates the dynamic content of your website.
Database (MySQL):

Role: Stores website data (user information, product listings, blog posts, etc.) in a structured format that the application can query and update.
Issues with a Single-Server LAMP Infrastructure

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the server goes down, your entire website is unavailable. Everything is on one machine.
Downtime for Maintenance: Deploying updates or performing server maintenance necessitates downtime, making your website temporarily unavailable.
Cannot Scale: A single server has limited processing power. If you experience a surge in traffic, the server may slow down or become unresponsive.
